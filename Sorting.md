# Sorting Algorithm Strategy
## data sets
all data sets are 512 items long
### fixed data sets
* already sorted: some algorithms are very slow to realize they don't need to do any work
* reverse sorted: every element needs to be moved
* almost sorted (5 items are in the wrong spot): how long does it take to move a few items
### randomized data sets
Make 5 random data sets, each with 512 items (with the numbers 0-511).
Store the data sets in a file for future usage.
Use the same randomized data sets for all the sorting algorithms.
## measurement
* comparisons
